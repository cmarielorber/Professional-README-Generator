It provides information about the app, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other web-developers can use and contribute to your project's success. Command-line applications allow for fast and efficient generation of a quality README which allows a you, the creator, to focus more time on the project itself instead of the README.
